# Discord Ladderbot

A Discord bot designed to manage and facilitate challenges between teams in a ladder-style competition. Teams can challenge others, track their rankings, and receive notifications when they are challenged.

## Features

- **Team Management**: Create and manage teams, including adding members and tracking wins and losses.
- **Challenge System**: Teams can challenge others up to two ranks above them. Challenges are exclusive and prevent other teams from challenging or being challenged until resolved.
- **Notifications**: Team members receive notifications when their team is challenged.
